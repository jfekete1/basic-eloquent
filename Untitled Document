Setup Eloquent

First, create a new folder in the public directory and name it “eloquent”. Now run the following composer command to install Eloquent.


composer require illuminate/database

Wait for composer to finish the installation.

Create a new file and name it bootstrap.php. I will use this file to setup Eloquent. Now paste the following code in it.


<?php



require "vendor/autoload.php";

use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;



$capsule = new Capsule;



$capsule->addConnection([

   "driver" => "mysql",

   "host" =>"127.0.0.1",

   "database" => "acl",

   "username" => "root",

   "password" => ""

]);

$capsule->setAsGlobal();

$capsule->bootEloquent();


The code starts with requiring the composer autoload class, then the required Eloquent Manager (Capsule), and finally created its instance. Through Capsule, I have set the database connection as global, and then booted Eloquent. After that, I created a new database on the localhost with the name “acl”.

Create Table For Migration

First create a new folder and name it “database”. Now, create a new file for the users table and name it “User.php”. Next, paste the following code in it:

 


<?php

require "../bootstrap.php";



use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;



Capsule::schema()->create('users', function ($table) {

       $table->increments('id');

       $table->string('name');

       $table->string('email')->unique();

       $table->string('password');

       $table->string('userimage')->nullable();

       $table->string('api_key')->nullable()->unique();

       $table->rememberToken();

       $table->timestamps();

   });

The above code is similar to what I would write in Laravel. The difference is the schema() with reference from Capsule class.  I will now create table for the roles. For that, create a new file and name it “Todo.php”. Paste the following code in it:

 


<?php

require "../bootstrap.php";



use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;



Capsule::schema()->create('todos', function ($table) {

       $table->increments('id');

       $table->string('todo');

       $table->string('description');

       $table->string('category');

       $table->integer('user_id')->unsigned();

       $table->timestamps();

       $table->foreign('user_id')->references('id')->on('users')->onDelete('cascade');

   });

I will now migrate all the files. For that open your browser and head to  eloquent/database/user.php and eloquent/database/todo.php. If you see a blank page, the tables have been migrated successfully.

Create Model Class With Eloquent

I will now create model classes using Eloquent.

Create a new folder and name it classes. Now open composer.json file and paste the following lines after require:



"autoload": {
 
       "classmap": [
 
           "classes"
 
       ]
 
   }
This will help me add classes folder as autoload. Now create a new file inside the classes folder and name it User.php.  Paste the following code:


<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model as Eloquent;

class User extends Eloquent

{

   /**
   * The attributes that are mass assignable.
   *
   * @var array
   */

   protected $fillable = [

       'name', 'email', 'password','userimage'

   ];

   /**
   * The attributes that should be hidden for arrays.
   *
   * @var array
   */

   protected $hidden = [

       'password', 'remember_token',

   ];

   /*
   * Get Todo of User
   *
   */

   public function todo()

   {
       return $this->hasMany('Todo');

   }

 }

Next, create a new file, name it Todo.php and paste the following code:


<?php



use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model as Eloquent;



class Todo extends Eloquent

{

   protected $fillable = ['todo','category','description'];

}

All the classes are now in place and I could go ahead with the testing.

Test the PHP Code

I will now create a new file at the root and name it index.php.  Open this file and paste the following code in it:


<?php

require "bootstrap.php";

$user = User::Create([    'name' => "Ahmed Khan",    'email' => "ahmed.khan@lbs.com",    'password' => password_hash("ahmedkhan",PASSWORD_BCRYPT), ]);

print_r($user->todo()->create([

   'todo' => "Working with Eloquent Without PHP",

   'category' => "eloquent",

   'description' => "Testing the work using eloquent without laravel"

   ]));

When you execute this file, you will see the following output:
